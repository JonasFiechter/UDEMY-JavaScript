/* 
Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics 
discipline, wich works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one 
average score per team)
A team only wins if it has at least Double of the average score of the other team. Otherwise,
no team wins!

1. Create an arrow function 'calc_average' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams.
3. Create a function 'check_winner' that takes the average score of each team as parameters
('avg_dolphins', 'avg_koalas'), and then logs the winner to console, together with victory 
points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win 30 vs 13".
4 Use the 'check_winner' function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.
ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
ยง Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
